# CS512 - Machine Learning

Sabanci University Machine Learning Project conducted under the supervision of Öznur Taştan.

Project scope: Deep mutational scanning (DMS) is a technique used by researchers to assess the effects of
mutations on protein function. This method achieves to identify connections between mutations and
their effects on molecular function and evolutionary processes. In this project, we focused on
pinpointing specific mutations and their locations on the GB1 protein that would affect its
interaction with IgG-Fc proteins. By implementing the MuMi (mutation and minimization) method,
we systematically generated all possible single mutations of GB1. This comprehensive approach
allowed us to construct a network graph, which then facilitated the development of an XGBoost
model, which delivers superior outcomes compared to prior investigations in the field.
