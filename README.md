# CS512 - Machine Learning

Sabanci University Graduate Project conducted under the supervision of Oznur Tastan and .

Project scope: Protein binding energy level prediction machine learning algorithm. Stage 1 (current) uses external hydrogen bond counts and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) data to predict. Further stages are envisioned to use internal hydrogen bond counts as well. Detailed exploration of the alterations in binding efficiency concerning both regions and amino acids using Network Graphs and XGBoost.
