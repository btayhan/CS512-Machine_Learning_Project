# CS512 - Machine Learning

Sabanci University Graduate Project conducted under the supervision of Oznur Tastan and .

Project scope: Protein binding energy level prediction machine learning algorithm. Stage 1 (current) uses external hydrogen bond counts and solvent accessible surface area (SASA) data to predict. Further stages are envisioned to use internal hydrogen bond counts as well.

 Developed with the collaboration of [Faraz Badali](https://github.com/return0ftheFaraz), Busra Tayhan, Alize Sevgi, and [Bilgehan Cagiltay](https://github.com/DivinorWieldor).
